Hi. I bet you like animals.
Theres somthing you really nead to know .WE SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THE ANIMALS THAT
STILL LIVE!!!!!!!

<h3>1.Its very inportent that we dont produce a lot of plastic.</h3>
 
<h2>2.If ..... this is a example (-:  If you se a lost or hurt animal whithout a mother  
i would first try to help if its not something big but if its something big and it is bleading
i would call the animal doctor.
