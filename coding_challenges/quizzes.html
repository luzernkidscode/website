<h2>Coding Challenge: Writing Quizzes</h2>

<h3>Part 1: Quiz with Points</h3>

Write a quiz that tracks how many questions the user got correct, and prints that number at the end of the quiz.
<br>
If you need a hint, take a look at this example quiz at the bottom of this page. 

<br><br>


<h3>Part 2: Hogwarts Sorting Quiz</h3>
Create a quiz that sorts you into a Hogwarts house (Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff). Use variables to track points for each house. Each question should add a point to one of the house points variables. At the end, figure out which house has the most points. 

<br><br>

<h3>Example Quiz</h3>

<pre><code class="python">
# Lines that start with '#' like this one aren't run by the computer. They are comments to explain what the code does. 

# First, create a variable to store the user's points
# The user starts with 0 points
num_points = 0

print("Let's see how much you know about penguins")

# use 'input' to ask a question and get an answer
answer = input("Can penguins fly? ")
if answer == "no":
  print("That's correct!")
  # add 1 to the variable storing the points
  num_points = num_points + 1

answer = input("Can penguins swim? ")
if answer == "yes":
  print("That's correct!")
  num_points = num_points + 1

answer = input("Can penguins teleport? ")
if answer == "no":
  print("That's correct!")
  num_points = num_points + 1

print("Quiz complete...")

# print the number stored in the num_points variable
print("You earned {} points".format(num_points))

# The '>' symbol means 'is larger than'
if num_points > 2:
  print("You're a penguin expert!")
# The '<' symbol means 'is smaller than'
if num_points < 2:
  print("You should spend more time with penguins.")
